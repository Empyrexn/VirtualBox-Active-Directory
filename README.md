What I learned doing this HomeLab:

1. Virtualization Technology
Understanding VirtualBox: Gained hands-on experience with VirtualBox, a hypervisor software that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine. This includes setting up and configuring VMs with various operating systems.
Virtual Network Configuration: Learned to configure different networking modes in VirtualBox such as NAT (Network Address Translation) and internal networking, essential for setting up isolated environments that mimic real-world network setups.
2. Windows Server Administration
Installation and Configuration: Installed Windows Server 2019 and configured it as a domain controller, learning about the setup and deployment of Windows Server operating systems.
Role and Feature Deployment: Gained practical experience in deploying roles and features like Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DHCP, and RAS (Routing and Remote Access).
3. Active Directory Management
Active Directory Setup and Management: Learned how to set up Active Directory, manage user accounts and organizational units, and understand the role of a domain controller in managing networked resources.
4. Networking Fundamentals
IP Addressing and Subnetting: Set up static IP configurations and understand IP addressing schemes, including subnetting, gateway configurations, and DNS settings.
Network Services: Configured essential network services such as DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation and DNS for name resolution.
5. Scripting and Automation
PowerShell Scripting: Utilized PowerShell to automate tasks such as user creation, demonstrating an ability to streamline administrative tasks through scripting.
Advanced Script Management: Managed and executed complex scripts that interact with Active Directory, enhancing both efficiency and reliability in system administration tasks.
6. Security and Access Controls
Remote Access and Routing: Configured Remote Access Services, setting up NAT and internal network communications, which are crucial for secure and controlled access to network resources.
User and Group Management: Through Active Directory, learned how to manage user permissions and security settings, crucial for maintaining organizational security protocols.
